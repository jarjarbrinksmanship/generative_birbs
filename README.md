# Generative-birbs

Most (all) of the credit goes to the owner of this repo: https://github.com/erdavids/Birds-of-a-Feather, which is where I found the original code. I've made a few modifications:

1. Refactored a bit to satisfy my own needs (it was not needed)
2. Changed around the color palettes
3. Gave them all names (h/t to my wife for a creating a list of 100 names in record time)

If you want to run this project yourself, make sure to download [Processing](https://www.processing.org) and use the Python module.
